	<h3> Design Decisions and Reasoning behind them</h3>

	<ul>
		<li>
			<strong>hackable to the core </strong>
			<p>
			Make it your own. Everything
			is created with extendability and modularity in mind.
			The Compiler is composed of multiple small programs
			which can be used and modified independently.
			They communicate with easy-to-understand formats.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>no macros</strong>
			<p>
				I made this decision to simplify the parsing of code
				and also because it makes code easier to read,
				as there is nothing that's 'hidden' away in some macro.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>no effort for backwards compatibility </strong>
			<p>
				ESPL1000 is a learning Project for me
				so anything might change whenever.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>strict evaluation</strong>
			<p>
				I chose strict evaluation over lazy evaluation because
				lazy evaluation is harder to reason about as a programmer, in my opinion.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>no user-defined prefix,infix or suffix operators</strong>
			<p>
				This greatly simplifies the parser. An Operator should map to a small sequence
				of machine instructions.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>not self-hosting</strong>
			<p>
				This simplifies development as there are many tools
				available for C development.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong> no need to declare a namespace, functions and structs are top-level </strong>
			<p>
				In my opinion, it does not make sense to force unneccessary indentation
				on people. The name of the file is the namespace of a translation unit.
				structs and functions can be declared and defined directly,
				without needing a wrapper like a class or namespace construct.
				This also makes code easier to read without context.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong> no unneccessary nesting of syntactic constructs </strong>
			<p>
				There are no nested method definitions or nested structures.
				Indentation is limited to the minimum necessary.
				I have personally never seen a case where it was necessary or
				'better' in any way to declare a nested function or anything like that.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong> simple syntax </strong>
			<p>
				ESPL1000 provides the basic building blocks like loops and if-statements
				that are classics to most programming languages.
				Extra stuff like bloated syntax is avoided whenever possible.
			</p>
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h3> Safety Goals </h3>

	<ul>
		<li>
			<strong>no null/NULL/undefined</strong>
			<p>
				Having 'NULL' makes it hard to understand code without
				context and knowledge of the code around it.
				Good code should make sense on it's own.
				So it should be obvious when a variable might not contain anything.
				So NULL will not be implemented in ESPL1000.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>no global state</strong>
			<p>
				ESPL1000 has no ability to declare any global variables.
				Everything is (currently) either inside a struct or method.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong> pure functions and impure methods explicit </strong>
			<p>
				A function declared pure should not contain calls to
				impure function. Purity of a function should be
				checked by the Compiler.
			</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
