/* This Module provides Facilities
 * for typechecking smalldragon Programs.
 * 
 * The AST Visitor is not used here because
 * it does not guarantee a particular visiting order
 * for nodes on the same level of depth in the AST.
 * 
 * For typechecking, the order is very important 
 * however, as the following example shows:
 * 
 * uint8 k = 3 + myfunction;
 * 
 * here we should typecheck the right-hand side
 * of the assignment first, before 
 * typechecking the assignment itself,
 * because the type inference would have problems
 * inferring the type of '3 + myfunction'
